# My First Demoscene Toy
![Toy](https://i.imgur.com/wKxflNA.png)

Sharing here first coding project that wasn't just a Bukkitplugin or console tool. 
This thing was born at Revision 2024 with Processing (https://processing.org/) at 6am on the Sunday out of boredom cause everyone was asleep and took me about 35-45min. 
Originally, I had plans to collaborate on a PS3 demo with a friend for the Wildcompo but stuff happend.
Coding for Cell isn't a walk in the park. And a lot of Work was left to do, so I did not even bother. 
Chilling on-site, participating in the IRC and Discord channels, observing others' work, and thoroughly enjoying every moment. 
So what is this thing: 
Have you ever recalled those days when a tool crashed and you found solace in doodling all over your desktop? This tool recreates that nostalgic effect within a 1080p window.

## Instructions:

Hoping to see you at the next Revision party
