# My first Contribution to the Demoscene

Sharing here first coding project that wasn't just a Bukkitplugin, console tool or webpage.  
This thing was born at Revision 2024 with Processing (https://processing.org/) at 6am on the Sunday out of boredom cause everyone was asleep and took me about 35-45min.  
Originally, I had plans to collaborate on a PS3 demo with a friend for the Wildcompo but stuff happend.  
Coding for Cell isn't a walk in the park. And a lot of Work was left to do, so I did not even bother.   
Chilling on-site, participating in the IRC and Discord channels, observing others' work.
  
So what is this thing:   
Have you ever recalled those days when a tool crashed and you found solace in doodling all over your desktop? This tool recreates that nostalgic effect within a 1080p window.  

```sql
## Instructions:
- **Left-click:** Use to draw with the Window.

Hoping to see you at the next Revision-Party

Frequently asked question:
Why did you not submit this to the PM / ORGA ?  
A: Java and after deadline.   
It resembled more of an on-site launch rather than a release through the party.   
I'm uncertain if it qualifies as a "Revision 2024 release", given that it got made at the party but wasn't officially released through it.
